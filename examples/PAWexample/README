Test is performed on O atom and O_2 molecule.  The idea is the following:

1) Generate a hard NC pseudopotential (NC1). This will be the
   reference for all other calculations, also for PAW calculations because
   PAW datasets will be constructed with lnc2paw=.true.
2) Generate a hard US PP (US1), and a PAW (PAW1) with the same augmentation
   functions, that is \phi^{NC1}\phi^{NC1}-\phi^{US}\phi^{US}.  They
   should give the same results as NC1.
3) Generate softer NC (NC2), US PP (US2), and PAW (PAW2) with the same
   augmentation functions, that is \phi^{NC2}\phi^{NC2}-\phi^{US}\phi^{US}.
   US2 should give the same results as NC2, while PAW2 should give the same
   results as PAW1 and NC1.
4) Generate very soft PAW (PAW4) with smooth augmentation functions (sums of 
   Bessel functions, see Kresse and Joubert, PRB 59, 1758 (1999) ) which 
   reproduce the moments of the exact augmentation functions.    

This folder contains:

* PSEUDO/
Pseudopotentials and PAW file descriptions, scripts for generating,
testing, and viewing the results: genAll.bash, testAll.bash, viewAll.bash.

* run_O1.bash O1/
Script for running single-atom O calculation with pw.x, and non-magnetic 
results 

* run_O2.bash O2_$dist/
Script for running O_2 calculation with pw.x, and results for interatomic
distance equal to 2*$dist 

* plot_O2_BindEn.bash
Script for visualizing O_2 binding energy.

* lsda/  lsda results for single-atom O calculations

Results:
- Notice that binding energy when the half-distance is lower than US
radii does not reproduce NC results.  Apart from that, NC, US, and PAW
all give similar results.
