Test is performed on O atom and O_2 molecule.  The idea is the following:

1) Generate an hard NC pseudopotential (NC1). This will be the
   reference for all other calculations, also for PAW calculations because
   PAW datasets will be constructed with lnc2paw=.true.
2) Generate an hard US PP (US1), and a PAW (PAW1) with the same augmentation
   functions, that is \phi^{NC1}\phi^{NC1}-\phi^{US}\phi^{US}.  They
   should give the same results as NC1.
3) Generate softer NC (NC2), US PP (US2), and PAW (PAW2) with the same
   augmentation functions, that is \phi^{NC2}\phi^{NC2}-\phi^{US}\phi^{US}.
   US2 should give the same results as NC2, while PAW2 should give the same
   results as PAW1 and NC1.

This folder contains:

* PSEUDO/
Pseudopotentials and PAW file descriptions, scripts for generating,
testing, and viewing the results: genAll.bash, testAll.bash, viewAll.bash.

* run_O1.bash O1/
Script for running single-atom O calculation with pw.x, and non-magnetic 
results 

* run_O2.bash O2_$dist/
Script for running O_2 calculation with pw.x, and results for interatomic
distance equal to 2*$dist 

* plot_O2_BindEn.bash
Script for visualizing O_2 binding energy.

* lsda/  lsda results for single-atom O calculations

Results:
- Notice that binding energy when the half-distance is lower than US
radii does not reproduce NC results.  Apart from that, NC, US, and PAW
all give similar results.
