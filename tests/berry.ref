     Program PWSCF     v.4.0.4  starts ...
     Today is 21Nov2008 at 18:11:26 

     Parallel version (MPI)

     Number of processors in use:       1

     For Norm-Conserving or Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials or PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     Iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem
     Too few procs for parallel algorithm
       we need at least 4 procs per pool

     a serial algorithm will be used
