This directory contains a few test for accuracy of PAW calculations. The
test consists of:

1) reference AE calculation
2) reference NC calculation with small cutoff radii (NChard)
3) NC with standard cutoff radii
4) US with standard cutoff radii
5) US with small cutoff radii (UShard)
6) PAW with standard cutoff radii, exact augmentation functions (PAW-AE-QAE)
7) PAW with standard cutoff radii, Bessel-type augmentation functions (PAW-AE-BESS)
8) PAW with standard cutoff radii, Gaussian-type augmentation functions (PAW-AE-BESS)

Pseudopotentials/datasets are gerenated by 
./genAll.bash

Three tests are performed by
./testAll-s.bash (for a scann in the 2S-orbital occupation from 2 to 0)
./testAll-p.bash (for a scann in the 2P-orbital occupation from 4 to 2)
./testAll-sp.bash (for a combined scann in 2S and 2P-orbital occupations from 2 & 4 tp 0 & 6 )

Results of the tests can be viewed by
./viewAll.bash
Everyting toghether can be done by 
./testAll3.bash
