This directory contains a test for accuracy of PAW calculations. The
test consists of:

1) reference AE calculation
2) reference NC calculation with small cutoff radii (NChard)
3) NC with standard cutoff radii
4) US with standard cutoff radii
5) US with small cutoff radii (UShard)
6) PAW with standard cutoff radii, exact augmentation functions (PAW-AE-QAE)
7) PAW built using NChard wavefunctions instead of AE ones and corresponding
   augmentation functions (PAW-NChard-Qhard)
8) as 7) with the same augmentation functions as US (4) (PAW-NChard-Qsmooth)

Execute with

./genAll.bash
./testAll.bash
./viewAll.bash

after changing

LD1_orig=~/espresso-CVS/bin/ld1.x
LD1_new=~/develop_PAW/bin/ld1.x

to point to a normal ld1.x executable and to one compiled with the
__PAW_FROM_NC__ option.

Notice that (8) reproduces the reference results (2) with similar
accuracy than (6) (for which the reference is (1)), whereas (4) is
much worse.

(4) is a standard US calculation, and (8) has the same wavefunctions,
projectors, local potential and augmentation functions so the
numerical cost should be similar.
